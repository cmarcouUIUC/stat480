```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(readr)
drugsComTrain_raw <- read_delim("drugsComTrain_raw.tsv", delim = "\t", escape_double = FALSE,  trim_ws = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tm)
dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(drugsComTrain_raw$review,
                          control = list(stopwords = TRUE, 
                                         removeNumbers = TRUE,
                                         removePunctuation = TRUE,
                                         stemming = TRUE))

```

```{r}
#look at matrix
head(dtm)
inspect(dtm[1:5, 1000:1005])
```

step 1 is to probably create word matrix

ok some ideas
--build topic model and or cluster words
--predict rating / review usefulness from words/bigrams/phrases
--if we do do a prediction compare straight glm/fdr analysis with lasso
--perhaps do a double lasso controlling for other variables like date/condition/review/usefulness.
